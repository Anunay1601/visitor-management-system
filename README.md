## Overview

Atithi VMS provides an enterprise-grade solution for managing visitors across multiple locations and departments. It enables front-desk operations to register visitors with face-biometrics, automatically triggers instant notifications to employee hosts via Telegram for real-time approvals, manages blacklist profiles, and generates comprehensive reports and analytics.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional paper-based visitor logbooks are insecure, hard to search, and prone to data leakage. Front desks often lack real-time mechanisms to verify visitor identities, warn of blacklisted individuals, or notify hosts of a guest's arrival instantly, resulting in security bottlenecks and communication gaps.

---

## Solution

Atithi VMS digitizes and automates the entire check-in workflow. By utilizing AI-powered face recognition, automated Telegram notifications, role-based access control, and tenant data isolation, the system ensures seamless workspace security, quick identity verification, and efficient communication between front desks and hosts.

## Features

### 🏢 Multi-Tenancy & Location Support
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation:** Secure data separation ensuring that different companies (tenants) can use the same server instance without cross-access.
- **Office/Branch Management:** Manage multiple offices, branches, and rooms (realms) under a single tenant.

### 👤 Guest Management & Security
- **Biometric Identity Scanning:** AI face recognition that captures and creates face embeddings to identify returning guests or flag blacklisted profiles.
- **Blacklist Restrictions:** Identify and restrict unwanted individuals with direct visual alerts at the reception desk.
- **Custom Master Data:** Configurable fields for visit purposes, departments, and ID card types.

### 💬 Real-Time Workflows
- **Instant Notifications:** Automatic Telegram messages dispatched to host employees when their visitor checks in.
- **Approval Actions:** Hosts can approve or reject visitor access requests with a single click from their dashboard.

### 📈 Reports & Logs
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Graphical widgets showcasing daily traffic volume, hourly check-in frequency, and department breakdowns.
- **Comprehensive Audit Trails:** Automatic logging of user logins, visitor registrations, check-in attempts, and profile modifications.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Visitor Arrival & Identification
The visitor arrives at the reception desk, and the receptionist initiates a quick camera scan. The backend uses the face service to extract an embedding and match it against existing profiles.

### Step 2: Form Check-In
If a match is found, guest details are pre-filled; otherwise, a new guest profile is registered. The receptionist selects the host employee and submits the check-in request.

### Step 3: Approval & Notification
The backend creates a pending visit log and dispatches an instant Telegram notification to the host. The host approves or rejects the request. Once approved, the guest enters. When the meeting ends, they check out.
